        <h1>Why Bulbasaur is the Best Starter Compared to Others</h1>
        <p>
            Bulbasaur stands out among all starter Pokémon, not just in Gen 1 but when compared to the starters of every generation. Here’s why Bulbasaur is a top pick:
        </p>
        <div class="gen-section">
            <h2>Generation 1 (Kanto)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bulbasaur</strong> has a type advantage against the first two Gyms (Rock and Water), making the early game much easier than Charmander or Squirtle.</li>
                <li>Access to status and healing moves gives Bulbasaur great versatility and survivability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="gen-section">
            <h2>Generations 2-9 Comparison</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Many Grass starters struggle with early-game Gyms or rivals, but Bulbasaur’s dual Grass/Poison typing gives it more resistances and offensive options.</li>
                <li>Compared to other Grass starters (like Chikorita, Treecko, Turtwig, Snivy, Chespin, Rowlet, Grookey, Sprigatito), Bulbasaur’s early access to healing and status moves makes it more beginner-friendly and strategic.</li>
                <li>Bulbasaur’s evolutionary line gains powerful moves and Mega Evolution, giving it long-term viability even in later generations.</li>
                <li>Unlike Fire or Water starters, Bulbasaur’s unique typing and move pool allow it to handle a wider variety of opponents, especially in the early game.</li>
                <li>Bulbasaur’s balanced stats make it less likely to be “outclassed” by rivals or wild Pokémon, a problem some other starters face in their respective games.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="gen-section">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                While every starter Pokémon has its strengths, Bulbasaur’s combination of early-game advantages, versatile movepool, and strong evolutions make it the best choice for new and experienced trainers alike—no matter which generation you compare!
